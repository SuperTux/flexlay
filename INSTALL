Installing Flexlay 
==================

Requirements:
=============

To compile Flexlay you need a recent ClanLib 0.7, quite often the
latest not-yet-released development version from the subversion tree,
available at:

  * http://www.clanlib.org

And you need scons (a make replacement) available at:

  * http://www.scons.org

In addition to that Ruby, available at:

  * http://www.ruby-lang.org

And for the games you need a recent copy of them, most often latest
development version of them is required.


Compilation:
============

Just type:

 $ scons

and it should build everything automatically if the prerequirements
are meet. 


Running:
========

The directories supertux/, netpanzer/, paint/, pingus/ and windstille/
contain the editors for the games, just run the executable scripts in
there. You might need to adjust the path to the game data, which is
currently hardcoded in the scripts.


Installing:
===========

Currently not supported, run directly from the source directory.
