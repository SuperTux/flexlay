# Flexlay

Flexlay is a generic 2D editor with special focus on games. It currently supports
multi layered tile-, object- and bitmaps, full undo/redo, support for tile-brushes,
easy copy/paste, multiple buffers, minimap support, a metadata editor and some
other stuff useful for creating levels for 2D games.

Supported games are at the moment:

- [SuperTux](http://supertuxproject.org/)
 
Flexlay can't be run on its own, but instead of you have to start it via wrapper
scripts (at the moment only `supertux-editor`).

For a more detailed guide to run the SuperTux version of Flexlay, see
[our guide in the wiki](https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/wiki/Installing-the-Flexlay-SuperTux-editor).

Flexlay is covered under the GNU GPL, which means that you can copy
and even modify it pretty much as you like, as long as you keep the
copyright headers in place and distribute the source along with any
distributed binaries, see the file `COPYING` for details.
