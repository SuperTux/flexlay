//: CL_SoundBuffer_Session provides control over a playing soundeffect.
//- !group=Sound/Audio Mixing!
//- !header=sound.h!
//- <p>Whenever a soundbuffer is played, it returns a CL_SoundBuffer_Session
//- class, which can be used to control the sound (its volume, pitch, 
//- pan, position). It can also be used to retrigger the sound
//- or to stop it.</p>

	//: Returns the sample position relative to the full length.
	//- <p>The value returned will be between 0 and 1, where 0

	//- means that the soundeffect has reached the end.</p>

	//: Returns the frequency of the session.

	//- is playing at "max" volume.</p>
