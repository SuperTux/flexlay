Readme file for ClanLib 0.8.x using MinGW under Win32
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This readme will guide you with installing, compiling ClanLib and
creating your first ClanLib application using the MinGW compiler and
MSYS toolset on Win32 or a gcc ix86-mingw32msvc cross-compiler (i.e.
you can compile ClanLib in Linux and then run the binaries in Windows!
(or even run them using a Windows emulator like Wine...)). You should
also be able to compile ClanLib with Cygwin, the ./configure script
will detect Cygwin and append the '-mno-cygwin -DWIN32' flags to the
compiler call.

5. Creating a simple application


1. Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile and use ClanLib you need some other libraries. As with any
ClanLib target you need to zlib, libjpeg and libpng. There are
links from the ClanLib download page (www.clanlib.org/download) to all
these libraries.

All libraries should be named as Unix libraries (i.e. libjpeg.a instead
of jpeg.lib) and has to be installed so that the compiler can find both
the archive files (*.a) and the include files.

You also need the DirectX libraries and headers version 7 or later. Just google
the net to find them. It should be possible to use the DirectX SDK from MS
but there are also some MinGW specific packages out there. At the moment
of writing there is a DirectX 7 MinGW package at:

 * http://caesar.logiqx.com/zips/tools/compilers/mingw/dx70_mgw.zip

Other additional libraries for MinGW can be found at (site looks a bit
outdated, but might still be helpfull):

 * http://mingwrep.sourceforge.net/

Instructions on how to build a cross-compile environment can be found
at:

 * http://www.libsdl.org/Xmingw32/

If you try to compile the other libraries from source you might
want to '--enable-static --disable-shared' at ./configure time since
often the DLL build process is a bit buggy and also doesn't lead to
having a standalone binary in the end, so static libraries should be
prefered.


2. Compiling ClanLib
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling ClanLib works buy using the standard ./configure script as
with most other Free Software.

ClanLibs configure script should be able to detect a mingw or cygwin
environment automatically and setup everything according to that. As
with other libraries, compiling a static library is recomment if you
want a binary that doesn't depend on extra .dll's. So to compile you
would do:

 ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared
 make
 make install

If you want to cross compile, you have to use the cross-configure.sh
scripts as documented on:

  * http://www.libsdl.org/Xmingw32/

or pass the target options manually.


3. Compiling ClanLib applications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you compile an application that uses ClanLib you have to use the
-mthreads option to enable multithreading.

Depending on which ClanLib modules you use you also may have to link with
some extra libraries:

Module          Extra linker flags

clanCore        -lz
clanDisplay     -lwinmm -lddraw -ldinput -ldxguid -ljpeg -lpng
clanGL          -lopengl32 -lglu32
clanSound       -ldsound -lwinmm
clanNetwork     -lws2_32

If you want to try the ClanLib examples in the Examples directory
you'll have to adjust the makefiles to include the above mentioned
compiler and linker flags. [FIXME: in the future this should be
handled automatically by pkg-config, but currently thats not the case]


4. Simple makefile example
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MY_GAME=my_great_game
OBJS=badies.o goodies.o lots_of_weapons.o

CXX=g++

CXXFLAGS= -mthreads
CLANLIBS= -lclanApp -lclanGL -lclanDisplay -lclanCore
EXTRALIBS= -lz -lwinmm -lddraw -ldinput -ldxguid -ljpeg -lpng \
           -lopengl32 -lglu32

PROGRAM: OBJS
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $(MY_GAME) $(OBJS) $(CLANLIBS) $(EXTRALIBS)


Note that you should minimum link with clanCore, clanDisplay, clanGL and 
clanApp.

Note that it is important to realize that in order to get your code 
compiled, some of the libraries should be put in a certain order. 

For example:
If you want to compile code that is involving GUI stuff, you will need
to link your program with clanGUI library. In addition, You might also 
need to include clanGUIStyleBoring and clanGUIStyleSilver libraries in
your makefile. These libraries should go before clanDisplay library, 
and both the clanGUIStyleBoring and clanGUIStyleSilver libraries should
be put before clanGUI. 

One possibility of the libraries orders would be:
   -lclanGUIStyleBoring -lclanGUIStyleSilver -lclanGUI -lclanApp -lclanGL 
   -lclanDisplay -lclanCore

If you need to link your program with any other libraries and the compiler
complains something about "undefined reference to <some stuff>", and
you are sure that the libraries that you link with, already contain the
<stuff>, you will probably need to shuffle your libraries order abit.

You may also need to check that the required libraries have already been
installed. The basic ClanLib libraries are:
clanApp, clanCore, clanDisplay, clanGL, clanGUI, clanGUIStyleBoring, 
clanGUIStyleSilver, clanNetwork, clanSignals, and clanSound
These libraries filenames are usually prefixed by "lib" and followed by 
".a", e.g. libclanApp.a


5. Creating a simple application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#include <ClanLib/core.h>
#include <ClanLib/application.h>
#include <ClanLib/display.h>

class MyApp : public CL_ClanApplication
{
public:
	virtual int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		// Create a console window for text-output if not available
		// Use printf or cout to display some text in your program
		CL_ConsoleWindow console("Console");
		console.redirect_stdio();

		try
		{
			// Initialize ClanLib base components
			CL_SetupCore setup_core;

			// Initialize the ClanLib display component
			CL_SetupDisplay setup_display;

			// Initialize the ClanLib GL component
			CL_SetupGL setup_gl;

			// Create a display window
			CL_DisplayWindow window("ClanLib application", 640, 480);

			// Run until someone presses escape
			while (!CL_Keyboard::get_keycode(CL_KEY_ESCAPE))
			{
				// Clear the display in a dark blue nuance
				// The four arguments are red, green, blue and alpha (defaults to 255)
				// All color nuances in ClanLib are measured in the interval 0->255
				CL_Display::clear(CL_Color(0, 0, 50));

				// Flip the display (using a double-buffer),
				// showing on the screen what we have drawed
				// since last call to flip()
				CL_Display::flip();

				// This call updates input and performs other "housekeeping"
				// Call this each frame
				// Also, gives the CPU a rest for 10 milliseconds to catch up
				CL_System::keep_alive(10);
			}
		}
		// Catch any errors from ClanLib
		catch (CL_Error err)
		{
			// Display the error message
			std::cout << err.message.c_str() << std::endl;
		}

		// Display console close message and wait for a key
		console.display_close_message();

		return 0;
	}
} app;
