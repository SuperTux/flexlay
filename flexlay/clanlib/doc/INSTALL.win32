1. Getting started
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need Microsoft Developer Studio 6.0 or 7.x/200x (.NET) with MFC
installed to follow this installation guide (see INSTALL.borland for
Borland specific instructions). The instructions here are mostly based
on VC 6.0, but you will be able to easily find the same options in VC 7.0.

Go to http://clanlib.org/download.html and download at least the zlib,
libjpeg and libpng multithreaded libraries. If you need more
functionality in ClanLib, you can download those other libraries you need.
(Check out the handy Windows External Libraries section!)

Install these libraries in a directory - remember which one, because you
need to enter that information in the next section.

If you are using VC6, You MUST install service pack 5 from 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp5/

It is also recommended to install latest Microsoft Platform SDK, which
will give you a much newer set of include files and libraries, making it
possible to use things Microsoft invented since 1998.  If you are using
VS.Net Express, then you will HAVE to do this.

The Microsoft Platform SDK is available at:
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/


2. Preparing installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first step in using ClanLib under Windows is to setup a sane build
environment. This involves two things:

1. ClanLib must be able to locate the libraries it uses.
2. ClanLib must know where to install itself.

My personal build environment is setup as follows using "c:\My Documents"
as base path. (You don't need to follow the same scheme, put your libraries
where it fits you).

"c:\My Documents\lib" contains all .lib files that didn't come along with
msvc++ and that are needed by ClanLib.

"c:\My Documents\include" contains all include files needed by the libs.

Here is how it looks like after I've installed Zlib:

c:\My Documents\lib\zlib.lib
c:\My Documents\include\zlib.h
c:\My Documents\include\zconf.h

You must configure Visual C++ so it knows where to find the include and 
library files.  This is done through the Tools -> Options -> Projects 
-> VC++ Directories.  Fill in the include directory
("c:\My Documents\include") under the Include Files listbox,
and the library directory ("c:\My Documents\lib") under the Library Files
listbox. 

IMPORTANT: Put the new include and library paths on the TOP of the lists
(to avoid it using dx3 for instance) UNLESS you are using VS.Net 2005.
In that case, make sure the PlatformSDK include folder is at the top of
the list.


3. Configuring ClanLib
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A freshly downloaded ClanLib source package will include a workspace/solution
and project for either MSVC6 (configure.dsw), or Visual Studio .NET 2005
(configure-vs80.sln).  This is a configuration tool that
will generate the real ClanLib workspace and project files. If you are using
Visual Studio .NET below 2005, use the configure.dsw file and answer yes
to the conversion.

You have to compile and run this wizard and answer its questions carefully.
Incorrect information will give you problems during the compilation.
After you've compiled the app, just run it from inside of the compiler.

When the configure wizard asks me where to install the header and library
files, I specify those paths from section 2 (C:\My Documents\include and
C:\My Documents\lib).

When this is done, open the ClanLib.dsw file if you are using Developer
Studio 6, or the ClanLib.sln file if you are using .NET version.  Answer
Yes to convert the file to your MSVC version if prompted.


4. Compiling ClanLib
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After loading the ClanLib workspace, the project view will show many different
projects; clanApp, clanCore, clanDisplay etc...

Start with making clanCore the active project, if its not active already.
You do this by right-clicking it, and select 'Set as Active Project'.
Select Debug or Release in the toolbar. If you can't find this option
anywhere, right click on the toolbar, and make sure Build is selected,
and deselect the Build Minibar. Press F7 to compile the active project.

You need to compile at least these projects:
- ClanApp
- ClanCore
- ClanDisplay
- ClanGL

Optionally, you can compile the others if you need them. Batch Build is
handy here.

You'll get some warnings for the different projects, similar to:

   ddraw.lib(DDRAW.dll) : warning LNK4006: __NULL_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR already
   defined in winmm.lib(WINMM.dll); second definition ignored

   GLU32.lib(GLU32.dll) : warning LNK4006: __NULL_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR already
   defined in OpenGL32.lib(OPENGL32.dll); second definition ignored

   LINK : warning LNK4098: defaultlib "LIBCMT" conflicts with use of other
   libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library

Ignore these warnings, they are not important.

For each library in ClanLib, we produce two .lib files, eg clanCore.lib and
clanCored.lib. The first one is for release versions of your game, and the
second is for debug versions.

The debug version includes debugging information in the library itself (so
if the lib crashes, you can see where in the source code it crashed).

After a successful compilation of ClanLib, it will automatically run a batch
file that will install all headers and lib files in the path you specified
in the wizard. In my case, that is "c:\My Documents\lib" and
"c:\My Documents\include". So the following files will be added:

c:\My Documents\lib\clanCore.lib  (release lib)
c:\My Documents\lib\clanCored.lib (debug lib)
c:\My Documents\lib\clanGL.lib
c:\My Documents\lib\clanGLd.lib

c:\My Documents\include\ClanLib\core.h
c:\My Documents\include\ClanLib\gl.h
...


5. Testing ClanLib
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To have a look at some examples of various parts of ClanLib, open the
Examples.dsw/.sln file in your ClanLib root directory. This was created after
you ran the Configure application.

Select any example, and compile it. You'll find examples covering most
parts of the ClanLib API.

Once you're done and ready for some coding, proceed to next section.


6. Creating applications with ClanLib
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that MSVC will know what .lib file to link into your application, based
upon the ClanLib headers you include in your application.

Example:
	If you include <ClanLib/core.h> then depending on whether you are
	building release or debug binaries the clanCore.lib or clanCored.lib
	library will be automatically linked into your executable. 


7. Creating a workspace for your application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.  Select File->New...
 2.  Select Projects->Win32 Application, and specify where you want it located.
 3.  Select "An empty project", and press OK till you're finished with the wizard.
 4.  Select Project->Settings...
     Notice there are several configurations in which you can modify settings.
     Normally, these are 'Win32 Debug' and 'Win32 Release'. You switch between
     these in the 'Settings for:' droplist. 
     In section 5 and 6 below, you need to modify both these settings
     (sections a for release setting, and sections b for debug settings).
 5.  Select the 'C/C++' tab, and then Category 'Code Generation'
 5a. For Release version, change the 'Use run-time library' to Multithreaded.
 5b. For Debug version, change the 'Use run-time library' to Debug Multithreaded.
 6.  Select Project->Add To Project->New...
 7.  Select C++ Source File, and enter a name for the file, for example 'app.cpp'
 8.  Enter a skeleton for your code:

#include <ClanLib/core.h>
#include <ClanLib/application.h>
#include <ClanLib/display.h>
#include <ClanLib/gl.h>

class MyApp : public CL_ClanApplication
{
public:
	virtual int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		// Create a console window for text-output if not available
		// Use printf or cout to display some text in your program
		CL_ConsoleWindow console("Console");
		console.redirect_stdio();

		try
		{
			// Initialize ClanLib base components
			CL_SetupCore setup_core;

			// Initialize the ClanLib display component
			CL_SetupDisplay setup_display;

			// Initialize the ClanLib GL component
			CL_SetupGL setup_gl;

			// Create a display window
			CL_DisplayWindow window("ClanLib application", 640, 480);

			// Run until someone presses escape
			while (!CL_Keyboard::get_keycode(CL_KEY_ESCAPE))
			{
				// Clear the display in a dark blue nuance
				// The four arguments are red, green, blue and alpha (defaults to 255)
				// All color nuances in ClanLib are measured in the interval 0->255
				CL_Display::clear(CL_Color(0, 0, 50));

				// Flip the display (using a double-buffer),
				// showing on the screen what we have drawed
				// since last call to flip()
				CL_Display::flip();

				// This call updates input and performs other "housekeeping"
				// Call this each frame
				// Also, gives the CPU a rest for 10 milliseconds to catch up
				CL_System::keep_alive(10);
			}
		}
		// Catch any errors from ClanLib
		catch (CL_Error err)
		{
			// Display the error message
			std::cout << err.message.c_str() << std::endl;
		}

		// Display console close message and wait for a key
		console.display_close_message();

		return 0;
	}
} app;
